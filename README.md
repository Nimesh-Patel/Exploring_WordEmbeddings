# Exploring_Embeddings
Experimenting with word2vec


**The goal** of this code is to explore word-embeddings learned via Word2Vec with Gensim (in Python 3). 

This is an *introductory, exploratory* jupyter notebook to get to know Word2Vec and some text analytic concepts/tools. For a *more rigorous tutorial and application* of Word2Vec, please see my [repo on how words are loaded with meaning](https://github.com/arsena-k/Word2Vec-bias-extraction).

**This notebooks explores**
1. Upload and Clean/Preprocess Data to feed into word2Vec
2. Learn Word2Vec Word Embeddings
3. Explore Word2Vec Word Embeddings 
    (3A. Word Similarities & Robustness;
    3B. Visualization with t-SNE & Robustness)
4. Word Embeddings as Features to Predict Author Gender
5. The Issue of Polysemy (words with more than one meaning, or "sense", like a river "bank" v.s. financial "bank")
