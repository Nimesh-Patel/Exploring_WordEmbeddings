# Exploring_Embeddings
Experimenting with word2vec


**The goal** of this code is to explore word-embeddings learned via Word2Vec with Gensim (in Python 3). 

*This notebooks explores*
1. Upload and Clean/Preprocess Data to feed into word2VecLearn Word2Vec Word Embeddings
2. Explore Word2Vec Word Embeddings 
3A. Word Similarities & Robustness
3B. Visualization with t-SNE & Robustness
4. Word Embeddings as Features to Predict Author Gender
5. The issue of polysemy (words with more than one menaning, or "sense", like a river "bank" vs financial "bank")
